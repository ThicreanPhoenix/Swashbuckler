             <summary>
             Damage can only ultimately be dealt as a damage event (a.k.a. an instance of damage). In Dawnsbury Days, a damage event is the result of a single damage roll (possibly modified by
             effects) against a single creature as part of a single, possibly subordinate, action.
            
             For example, a Strike always results in only a single damage event, even if the damage is modified by additional fire or alignment damage. A spell that deals fire and good damage at
             to the same creature creates a single damage event, but if it does so to multiple creatures, then those creatures each have separate damage events.
