# Swashbuckler

This mod adds the Swashbuckler, a fast-moving, precise-striking melee combatant, as a playable class into the game, with 5 distinct styles, 22 brand new feats, and a unique intentional Tumble Through action.

It also adds 2 weapons introducing the Parry trait: The bo staff and the main-gauche.
